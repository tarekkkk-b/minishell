im just gonna try to break it down to see how things should go and flow using pseudo
code, there wil be sections that will be expanded on, ill refer to them with * and youll
see them expanded on down below

this will be like our rough sketch and we will keep expanding on it later, add
pieces wherever we need just so we can map things out and actually be able to
work.


	//MINISHELL SECTION


			//main
				//check args == 1
				//initiate loop
					//call READ* and return string from user inp
					//send string to PARSING* and recieve array of structs
						//if parsing passes
							//send structs for EXEC*
								//free execution if error encountered
									//save exit status
					//add status to struct
					//free alloc
				//loop again


	//DATA GATHERING SECTION


			//READ*
				//getcwd
					//save oldwd
				//strjoin w "> "
				//readline w path
					//check string
						//if passes, add to history
				//return string


	//PARSING SECTION


			//PARSING*
				//NODING*
					//if presence of "invalid"
						//return error
				//STRUCTING*
					//return true/false



			//NODING*
				//loop thru characters
					//function to check if its start of word/operator
						//collect until meta char found
							//identify TYPE*
								//if invalid
									//error
								//else
									//store node
				//loop again from new pos



			//STRUCTING*
				//iterate thru nodes to count pipes
					//alloc for n_pipes + 1 structs
				//store nodes into structs
					//store redirections
					//store commands and options
					//etc
					//get pointer to next struct
				//check SYNTAX*
					//prevent exec if false
				//return structs



			//SYNTAX*
				//referred to from file /notes/grammar.txt
				//if syntax error
					//save loc of error
					//save stat
					//return false
				//return true



			//TYPE*
				//if opt
					//check if prev node == opt
						//set invalid
				//if word
					//gather full
					//set word
				//if space
					//check if prev was space
						//if yes -> ignore
							//else store space (once only)


	//EXECUTION SECTION


			//EXEC*
				//looping in number of structs
					//fork process
						//determining input dir (file/pipe/heredoc)
							//dup data
								//if heredoc present
									//get all heredoc
								//COMMAND*
									//if any, expand variables
								//attempt to exec command as is (incase of path)
								//else
								//join to path dir and exec
									//set status
									//free and return if error
						//determine output dir
							//create redirections files
								// dup to last dest of output
				//loop again



			//COMMAND*
				//find the type of command in q
					//if builtin
						//if !piped
							//send directly to builtins exec
						//if piped
							//fork for builtin
								//exec builtin in child
					//if env related 
						//check list of env commands
							//unset, export, variable, etc
					//if reg command
						//return to exec
